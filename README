EWalker
-------

This erlang application regularly reads the configured folders and
generats an atom feed. The feed contains all found files with a link
to the file.
Through this, Clients using this feed will be notified about new files
and modifications in the folders. The main use-case is to watch network-
shared folders for media data, e.g. Pictures or Videos.


Configuration (Example)
1. Configure your webserver to serve your data folder, e.g. /public as http://localhost/public
2. Configure the ewalker.config file and replace the paths and the mappings as needed  
   The configuration file does not support environment variables.
3. Start the application:
    
   $ erl -boot start_sasl -pa ebin/ -s ewalker -config ewalker


Hoptoad integration:
If you replace the 'undefined_in_appfile' atom in the config with your apikey (enclosed by double quotes),
the startup logic starts the erlhoptoad application, which sends errors to HopToad.
