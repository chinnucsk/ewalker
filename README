EWalker
-------

This a erlang application regularly reading the configured folders and
generating an atom feed. The feed contains all found files with a link
to the file.


Configuration (Example)
1. Configure your webserver to serve your data folder /public as http://localhost/public
2. Configure the ewalker.config file and replace the paths and the mappings  
3. Start the application:
    
   $ erl -boot start_sasl -pa ebin/ -s ewalker -config ewalker


Hoptoad integration:
If you replace the 'undefined_in_appfile' atom in the config with your apikey (enclosed by double quotes),
the startup logic starts the erlhoptoad application, which sends errors to HopToad.
